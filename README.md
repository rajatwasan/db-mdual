# Implementation of Multiple Dynamic Outlier-Detection from a Data Stream by Exploiting Duality of Data and Queries

## 1. Configuration

This code was written on CPP with GCC Compiler verion 8.3.0 on windows platform. It is recommended to use windows for some library functions used in the code. Most of the code works on Linux and Mac platform as well.

## 2. Implementation

To detect outliers in Code Run Outliers.cpp 

    cpp test/Outlier.cpp

To check CPU and Memory used run Load.cpp with these commands:

    cpp test/Load.cpp

## Datasets
Code includes the three datasets and respective querysets in the codebase. To test these datasets or querysets, change the name in Outliers.cpp or Load.cpp file and compile and run.
